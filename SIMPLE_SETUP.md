# ðŸš€ Super Simple Email Verification Setup

## Works Immediately (No Setup Required!)

The email verification system works out of the box in development mode:

1. **Start the app:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test verification:**
   - Go to `http://localhost:3000/verify`
   - Enter any UF email (e.g., `test@ufl.edu`)
   - Click "Send Verification Email"
   - **The OTP will appear in a browser alert!**
   - Enter the 6-digit code to verify

## Optional: Real Email Setup (5 minutes)

To send actual emails, just add these 2 lines to `.env.local`:

```bash
GMAIL_USER="your-email@gmail.com"
GMAIL_PASS="your-gmail-app-password"
```

### How to get Gmail App Password:
1. Go to [Google Account Settings](https://myaccount.google.com/)
2. Security â†’ 2-Step Verification (turn on if not enabled)
3. Security â†’ 2-Step Verification â†’ App passwords
4. Generate password for "Mail"
5. Copy the 16-character password

That's it! No database, no complex setup needed.
